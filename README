pycoreutils
Python re-implementation of GNU coreutils

WHY?
Why not?  Could be useful to someone.  Maybe the PyOS project.

DEVELOPMENT
Put the drivers for the commands in src/.  These should contain a main()
function and do the argument processing.  Put the core functionality for
the program in a pycoreutils module and import it in the driver.

To test drivers, make sure you set a PYTHONPATH environment variable so
that python can find the pycoreutils modules in this directory:

   export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)

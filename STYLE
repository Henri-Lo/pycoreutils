Style
   Please follow the same style that has been followed for the other
   scripts.

   * We use tab characters for indentation, not spaces.
   * Each .py file has a GPL boilerplate at the top with the name of
     the author (you).  Add yourself to the COPYRIGHT file if you
     are not already there.

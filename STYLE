   These programs are the commands.  The ones that replace the /bin and
   /usr/bin commands in GNU coreutils.

   The driver should contain a ver tuple with the major and minor version
   number.  The version is unique to the command.

   The driver should contain all functionality in a main() function and
   call that main() function from the bottom of the script in an
   if __name__ == "__main__" block.  Within reason, of course.  Your
   main() function is allowed to call other functions that you make, but
   they should all be contained in the single command.

   Supplementary module.  Some things have to be implemented as Python
   extension modules in C, so we do that here and then import them in to
   the frontend command in src/

Style
   Please follow the same style that has been followed for the other
   scripts.

   * We use tab characters for indentation, not spaces.
   * The #! interpreter is to be '/usr/bin/env python -tt'
   * Each .py file has a GPL boilerplate at the top with the name of
     the author (you).
   * Add yourself to the AUTHORS file if you aren't already listed.
